# Programming Language
An unnamed compiled programming language, currently contains very little functionality. Name suggestions are welcome (can be done via an issue or danterus#5291 on discord).

Currently only supports linux, but it is designed to eventually be ported to other platforms like Windows, MacOS, and WebAssembly.

## Documentation
TBD (see **example** directory)

## Running
To run one of the examples (only currently functional for linux):
```
python programming_language.py example/[example].lang -r
```
